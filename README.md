## Description

_This application will convert entered text into Pig Latin

Epicodus' rules for Pig Latin: 
For words that start with a vowel, add "ay" to the end
For words that start with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end and add "ay". (If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q")
For words that start with "y", treat the "y" as a consonant.
